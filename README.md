# ASE Revised Thresholds for WBC and Temperature
Optimized WBC and temp thresholds for early sepsis detection

# Project Overview:
Traditionally accepted ranges for white blood cell (WBC) counts (4 – 12 x10⁹/L) and temperature (36 - 38°C) in sepsis were originally derived from expert consensus in the early 1990s and continue to play a prominent role in driving suspicion of potential sepsis cases and associated clinical decision making. 

**Our aim is to evaluate optimized WBC and temperature thresholds using real-world, large-scale EHR data**. For this project, sepsis is defined using the CDC Adult Sepsis Event (ASE) criteria which requires:
1. A presumed serious infection as evidenced by blood culture collection and a minimum of four consecutive days of antibiotics (some exceptions for discharge locations / expiration)
2. Evidence of end organ dysfunction.
   
This study limited sepsis cases to community acquired sepsis.

# Data Sources

# Required CLIF tables
The following tables are required:
1. hospitalization: patient_id, hospitalization_id, admission_dttm, discharge_dttm, age_at_admission, discharge_category
2. adt: hospitalization_id, location_category
3. labs: hospitalization_id, lab_order_dttm, lab_value, lab_value_numeric, lab_category, lab_result_dttm
4. vitals: vital_category, vital_value, recorded_dttm
5. microbiology_culture: fluid_category, order_dttm, organism_name
6. medication_admin_intermittent: med_group, med_name, admin_dttm
7. medication_admin_continuous: med_group, admin_dttm
8. respiratory_support: device_category, recorded_dttm

# Inclusion Criteria:
